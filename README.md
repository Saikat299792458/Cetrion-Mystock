# Cetrion-Mystock
An attempt to make my personal trading bot.
The Update.py file scrapes the DSE website to collect closing price (Historical or Daily) and saves them in a directory.
The first run may take a long time, as the file sets everything up.
The file should be converted into an application and added to the registry tree to make data update process automatic.
